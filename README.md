## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structuring content.
- **CSS3** and **Bootstrap 5** for styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript** for interactive elements.
- **Font Awesome** for icons.

- **Accessibility:** Includes skip links, aria roles, alt text for images, and proper HTML syntax for accessibility.
- **Bootstrap Framework:** Utilized for layout, typography, and components.
- **Blooming Menu:** This is an animated radial menu for navigation styled like a blooming flower using the Blooming Menu JavaScript library.
- **Custom CSS:** for additional styling beyond Bootstrap's capabilities.
- **Hover and Focus States:** Applied with transitions for links and buttons.

## Challenges and Learning
- **Responsive Design:** Leveraging Bootstrap's grid system and media queries ensured the site works across various devices.
- **Accessibility:** To make the site more inclusive, I implemented accessibility features such as skip links and aria roles.
- **Custom Navigation:** Creating a custom radial navigation menu involved integrating the Blooming Menu library and ensuring it fits into the overall design and user experience.
- **Integrating External Libraries:** Worked with external CSS and JavaScript libraries for enhanced functionality.
- **Design Conversion:** Converting high-fidelity designs from the User Experience Design course into functional HTML and CSS.
- **Image Optimization:** Used the `<picture>` element with `srcset`, `sizes`, and media attributes for optimized images.
- **Overcoming Bootstrap Limitations:** Used Google Chrome's inspect element tool and W3Schools to resolve styling conflicts with Bootstrap.
